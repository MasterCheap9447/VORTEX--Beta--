# VORTEX
VORTEX is a movement shooter inspired by ULTRAKILL by Arsi 'Hakita' Patala. In it you are a robot sent by the nazist to conquer Earth in a timeline set in the far fututre where an infection led to the mutation of animals and life turning them into monster. This resulted in the loss of human life. Humans are at the brink of extinction. Germany [ Now Empiral NAZI ], United States of America and Khazakhstan have fled to Mars as it was the next best planet to inhabit. Each continent has a core in it which if you destroys kills all the mutanats connected to it. Destroy all the cores and conquer Earth.
